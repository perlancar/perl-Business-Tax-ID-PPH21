The law ("undang-undang") for income tax ("pajak penghasilan") in Indonesia is
UU 7/1983 (along with its several amendments, the latest of which is UU
36/2008). This law is comprised of several articles ("pasal"). Article 21
("pasal 21") regulates earned income, which is income generated by
individual/statutory bodies from performed work/services, including: employment
(salary and benefits, as well as severance pay), freelance work, business,
pension, and "jaminan hari tua" (life insurance paid to dependents when a worker
is deceased). Article 21 also regulates some types of passive income, which is
income generated from capital or other non-work sources, including: savings
interests, gifts/lotteries, royalties.

Some other passive income like rent and dividends are regulated in article 23
("pasal 23") instead of article 21. And some articles regulate other aspects or
special cases, e.g. income tax for sales to government agencies/import/specific
industries ("pasal 22"), rules regarding monthly tax payments ("pasal 25"), or
rules regarding work earned in Indonesia by non-citizens ("pasal 26").

This module contains several routines to help calculate income tax article 21.
